 Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning” 
Developed a machine learning model to predict diabetes onset based on patient health data. Focused on optimizing 
model performance through data preprocessing, feature selection, and algorithm comparison, with the goal of 
improving early diagnosis and supporting preventive healthcare strategies. 
Description 
● Data sourced from Kaggle, analyzing the variables and understand the domain. 
● I conducted thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key patterns and relationships within the 
data, employing visualizations and statistical summaries. 
● Data preprocessing included handling missing values through imputation, normalizing features to ensure 
consistency, and addressing class imbalance using techniques like Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique 
(SMOTE). Feature engineering played a crucial role in selecting and constructing relevant variables that significantly 
influence diabetes risk. 
● I implemented and compared several machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random 
Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Model evaluation was performed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, 
and the F1 score to determine the best-performing model. 
● This project showcased my ability to manage data workflows, apply advanced machine learning techniques, 
and contribute to enhanced preventive healthcare strategies through data-driven solutions.
